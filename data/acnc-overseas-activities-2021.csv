Their activities are regulated by the Social Welfare Council (SWC) which is the Government body in Nepal that manages the registration and operations of charities. NHEDF is required to comply with all in-country legislation and work within specific governance frameworks and financial reporting requirements, including the submission of audited financial accounts in order to maintain their SWC registration. We usually also fund medical and surgical costs for patients at NHEDF's Shelter and medical and surgical intervention for women referred to them with obstetric fistula. This financial year this was not required. Nepal was faced with huge numbers of COVID-19 patients, hospitals filled to capacity, stretched resources, repeated bans on elective surgery and frequent lengthy lockdowns. Only emergency surgery was performed. This year NHEDF lodged an application to the SWC to change their name. This is still pending.","We have worked with NHEDF to provide broader, more detailed, inclusive policies to further foster safety, due diligence, transparency, accountability and good governance. We have also facilitated ongoing educational opportunities for NHEDF's clinical staff. We do not deliver these programs - we simply fund their work and NHEDF's Shelter is in Kathmandu in Nepal. Program delivery is undertaken by our project partner Nepal Healthcare Equipment Development Foundation. We simply support their work."
